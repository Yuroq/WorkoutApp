<h2 style="font-size:40px">Description</h2>
<p>Project was influenced by my love for working out,staying healthy and JavaScript. I wanted to get better at using different API’s and writing cleaner code , so what’s better than combining the two!

I used the Mapty API.

</p>
<h2 style="font-size:40px">Aim for this project:</h2>
<p>The primary aim of this project is to develop an exceptional workout app that revolutionizes how users track their biking and cycling workouts. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and APIs, I am dedicated to creating a seamless web application that empowers fitness enthusiasts to stay on top of their training progress.

With this app, users will have access to real-time data and insights about their biking and cycling workouts. They can effortlessly monitor their distance, speed, duration, and other essential metrics, enabling them to set goals, track their achievements, and stay motivated on their fitness journey.

But this project goes beyond just creating a workout tracking app. It is an exciting opportunity for me to push the boundaries of my JavaScript skills and delve into the world of API integration. By seamlessly connecting with fitness data sources and handling complex data structures, I am honing my expertise in JavaScript and expanding my understanding of API usage.

<h2 style="font-size:40px">How to use:</h2>
<p>Move the code files to your favorite code editor, from there go to the ”Index.html” HTML file and open up the live server, 

From there the browser shoudld ask you to use your location, accept it.

Then press the place you want to run or cycle on the map, from there a form on the right should ask you to fill out a couple of things
  
After you fill the form out a pointer on will appear on the map where you clicked, and the workout will be saved on the right and on the map.
  
You can delete a workout by pressing on the workout or by pressing the trash can emoji to delete all of the workouts.

*This project is from Jonas Schmedtmann's complete JavaScript course, this was the final project! I used his videos wherever I would get stuck on a part or if I needed help understanding how something works on the project.*
